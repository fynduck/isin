A Laravel package for generate and validating an ISIN (International Securities Identification Number / ISO 6166).

ISINs will be checked against the checksum as detailed at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number]

## Installation
The library can be installed via composer
```
composer require fynduck/isin
```

## Usage
You can instantiate an ISIN object by passing in a string
```php
use fynduck\Isin;

$number = 'GB00B3W23161';
$isin = new Isin($number);
```

If the value passed in was not a valid ISIN it will throw a ```fynduck\Isin\Exception\InvalidISINException```
To get the value back out you can do

```
$isin->getValue();
return GB00B3W23161
```

If you want to get hold of just the check digit you can use

```
$isin->getCheckDigit();
return 1
```

### Generate ISINs
```
Isin::generateDigit('GB00B3W2316');
return: 1
```

### Validating ISINs
There are some helper static functions for simple validation.

```
Isin::isValid('GB00B3W23161');
return true
```

This will return true if the value was a valid ISIN, false otherwise.

```
Isin::validate('gb00b3w23161');
return GB00B3W23161
```
```
$number = Isin::validate('ABC');
return InvalidISINException
```

This will return the properly formatted ISIN (whitespace trimmed and converted to uppercase).
It will throw a ```fynduck\Isin\Exception\InvalidISINException``` if the input was not valid.
